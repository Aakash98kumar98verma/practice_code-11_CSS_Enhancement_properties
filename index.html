     <h3>Problem Statement 4: Float</h3>
     <h4>Gautam Buddha</h4>
     <img src="./img.png" height="250px" alt="buddha">
     <p id="problem4">Gautama Buddha was born in Lumbini of Kapilvastu in 563 BC located in Nepal. Gautama Buddha's
          mother's name
          was "Maya Devi" and father's name was "Shudodhan". His mother died in 7 days after the birth of Gautam
          Buddha. After the death of his mother, he was raised by his aunt and stepmother. The childhood name of
          Gautam Buddha was Siddhartha. Later, he was named Gautam Buddha due to his birth in Gautam Gautra.
          Siddhartha completed his education from Guru "Vishwamitra". Siddharth was kind and compassionate since
          childhood. He did not want to be the cause of anyone's grief. He used to lose himself in sports too, so
          that the loser does not feel sad. Gautam was given all the material pleasures to stop him from leaving
          the palace. He fell into deep contemplation at first sight of illness and death, and decided to find a
          way to end the suffering. Gautam left his wife, kingdom and son Rahula to find the solution to suffering.
          After six long years of penance and meditation, he finally attained enlightenment under the bodhi tree.
          Gautama taught the noble eight-fold path to free oneself from suffering until he died.</p>
